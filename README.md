PostDia
=======

PostDia is a collection of Postgres SQL plugins for Dia that let you visualise databases as UML models in Dia and then export them to Postgres SQL either as raw SQL or directly to a server.
It also enables you to import the schema of an existing Postgres SQL database directly into Dia from the server.
