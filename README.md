PostDia
=======

PostDia is a collection of PostgreSQL plugins for Dia that let you visualise databases as UML models in Dia and then export them to PostgreSQL either as raw SQL or directly to a server.
It also enables you to import the schema of an existing PostgreSQL database directly into Dia from the server.

What it does
------------

- it will import a database from a PostgreSQL server and create a UML diagram which is, for the most part, based on the tedia2sql format - 
http://tedia2sql.tigris.org/usingtedia2sql.html
There is a sample Dia file included which was generated by the plugin.

- it will export a UML diagram based on the above specification to a PostgreSQL compatible SQL file. 

What it doesn't do yet
----------------------

- Upload to the server directly. The idea is to either allow database creation for new schema or to diff against an existing one.

What it will probably never do
------------------------------

- Import from an SQL file. That's some voodoo that I don't really want to mess with for now. It would be an interesting exercise in being able to use Dia as an intermediary between different SQL formats but...

- Work for other Databases such as MySQL or SQLite. Not that I have anything against them, I just don't use them. Feel free to read through my poorly written Python code and figure out if you can adapt it. Fork it or push me the changes if you feel so inclined.
